🚦 AI-Driven Traffic & Parking Management System

An AI-driven traffic and parking management system that uses data analytics and machine learning to analyze urban traffic patterns and predict congestion levels and parking availability through an interactive dashboard.

📌 Project Overview

Urban areas face increasing challenges related to traffic congestion and inefficient parking management. This project presents a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that demonstrates how data analytics and machine learning can be used to support smarter urban mobility decisions.

The system analyzes traffic and parking data, predicts traffic congestion levels, and forecasts parking availability. The results are presented through an interactive dashboard for easy understanding and decision support.
